/**
 * 递增的三元子序列
 * 给定一个未排序的数组，判断这个数组中是否存在长度为 3 的递增子序列。
 * <p>
 * 数学表达式如下:
 * <p>
 * 如果存在这样的 i, j, k,  且满足 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1，
 * 使得 arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] ，返回 true ; 否则返回 false 。
 * 说明: 要求算法的时间复杂度为 O(n)，空间复杂度为 O(1) 。
 * <p>
 * 示例 1:
 * <p>
 * 输入: [1,2,3,4,5]
 * 输出: true
 * 示例 2:
 * <p>
 * 输入: [5,4,3,2,1]
 * 输出: false
